# Advanced Python Hooks

Cutting-edge Python hook patterns using decorators, async, and event-driven architectures.

## Experiments

### Decorator Hook Patterns
Advanced decorator composition, chaining, and meta-programming patterns for hook-based architectures.

### Async/Await Hooks
Async context managers, coroutine hooks, and concurrent execution patterns.

### FastAPI/Flask Middleware Hooks
Request/response lifecycle hooks, authentication hooks, and middleware composition.

### Signal & Event Hooks
Event-driven patterns using Python signals, custom event systems, and observer patterns.

### Plugin System Hooks
Dynamic plugin loading, hook registration systems, and extensible architectures.

## Goals
- Explore Python's decorator and metaprogramming capabilities
- Build reusable hook patterns for async Python
- Create composable middleware and plugin systems
- Optimize performance with hook-based architectures
