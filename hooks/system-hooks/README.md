# System-Level Hooks

OS-level hooks and low-level system integration patterns.

## Experiments

### OS Event Hooks
File system, process, and network monitoring hooks for system events.

### IPC Hooks
Inter-process communication patterns using hooks for message passing.

### Native Module Hooks
Bridge patterns between Node.js and native code using hook abstractions.

## Goals
- Explore system-level hook patterns
- Build OS integration abstractions
- Create reusable system monitoring hooks
