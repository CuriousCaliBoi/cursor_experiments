## Philosophy

Each experiment explores:
- **Composability** - How hooks can be combined for complex behaviors
- **Performance** - Optimizing hook-based architectures
- **Developer Experience** - Making advanced patterns accessible
- **Real-world Applications** - Solving actual problems with hook patterns
